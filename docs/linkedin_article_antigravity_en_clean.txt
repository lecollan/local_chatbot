🚀 From 0 to Local Chatbot in < 30 mins: My Experience with Google Antigravity

How long does it usually take you to build a functional prototype with a technology you've never used? Hours? A weekend?

Today I want to share an experience that has changed the way I view software development. I've been testing Google Antigravity, the new Agentic IDE that is redefining how we code. I asked it to create a local chatbot for me.

I didn't tell it what technologies to use. I didn't write a single line of code.

👉 The Result: In less than 30 minutes, Google Antigravity had an LLM running on my laptop, with a GUI, documented, and uploaded to my repository.

🤯 How does Google Antigravity work?

It's not just a code editor with a chat window. It's a complete Agentic IDE where an autonomous Senior Engineer works alongside you:

1. 🧠 Automatic Planning
The IDE analyzed my request ("I want a local chatbot") and designed an instant implementation plan within the editor itself.

2. 🛠️ Intelligent Stack Selection
It chose the best tools for the job without me having to debate it:
• Ollama: For model management.
• Gemma 2b: Google's model, for being lightweight and powerful for local use.
• Python + Streamlit: For a fast and clean UI.

3. ⚡ Autonomous Execution
• Repo Management: It initialized the Git repository, created the .gitignore, and structured the project.
• Documentation: It wrote the README.md with step-by-step instructions.
• Coding: It wrote the complete chatbot_app.py script and dependency files.
• Deployment: It even uploaded all the code to my personal GitHub automatically.

🏆 The Future of Coding

A private, secure, and free assistant running on my own machine. No complex configurations, no dependency errors keeping me debugging for two hours.

This is the power of Google Antigravity: an environment where the IDE creates files, executes terminal commands, and manages version control for you. It transforms the developer from a "code typist" to a "Solution Architect".

If you are a developer, this doesn't take your job, it gives you superpowers. 🦸‍♂️
